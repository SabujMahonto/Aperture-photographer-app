            What is the difference between Authentication and Authorization?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-slate-400">
            <strong>Authentication</strong> is the process of identifying users
            and validating who they claim to be. One of the most common and
            obvious factors to authenticate identity is a password. If the user
            name matches the password credential, it means the identity is
            valid, and the system grants access to the user.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-400">
            <strong>Authorization</strong> happens after a userâ€™s identity has
            been successfully authenticated. It is about offering full or
            partial access rights to resources like database, funds, and other
            critical information to get the job done.

            Why are you using firebase? What other options do you have to
            implement authentication?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-slate-400">
            I do use firebase for implementing authentication system in the
            application. Firebase is a service of google. Since, authentication
            means the transaction of very important data like email, phone,
            password, credit card info, so i chose google to handle these.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-400">
            There are so many alternatives of firebase to implement
            authentication. Some of them are Auth0, Passport, Okta, Keycloak
            etc.

            What other services does firebase provide other than authentication?

          <p className="text-slate-400">
            There are so many services firebase provide other than
            authentication. Here are some of them-
